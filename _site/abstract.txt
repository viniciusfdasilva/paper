Title: The Demikernel Datapath Architecture for Microsecond-scale
Datacenter Systems

Abstract:

Datacenter systems and I/O devices now run at single-digit microsecond
latencies, requiring nanosecond-scale operating systems. Traditional
kernel-based operating systems impose an unaffordable overhead, so
recent kernel-bypass OSes (e.g., Arrakis, Ix) and libraries (e.g.,
Caladan, eRPC) eliminate the OS kernel from the I/O datapath. However,
none of these systems offer a general-purpose datapath OS replacement
that meet the needs of microsecond-scale systems.

This talk proposes Demikernel, a flexible datapath OS and architecture
designed for heterogenous kernel-bypass devices and microsecond-scale
datacenter systems. We have built two prototype Demikernel datapath
OSes and show that minimal effort is needed to port existing
microsecond-scale systems. Once ported, Demikernel lets applications
run across heterogenous kernel-bypass devices with nanosecond-scale
overheads and no code changes.
