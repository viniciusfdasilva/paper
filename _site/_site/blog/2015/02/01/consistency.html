            <h2>Consistency should be more consistent!</h2>
	    
            <p>I hadn’t thought that I would blog, but since Jekyll makes it so easy,
I’m feeling like I need to give it a whirl. No promises about how
often this will happen, of course, because the virtual world is
littered with dead blogs of the well-intentioned.</p>

<p>I thought I would try to clear up, if only for myself, the terminology
surrounding consistency and isolation, or, more specifically,
<em>operation and transaction ordering</em>. Of course, there have been a
large number of discussions and blog posts that are a rabbit-hole of
the illuminating and horrifying.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking and talking about this stuff a lot lately because I
am TA’ing UW’s <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/">undergraduate distributed systems
class</a> and working
on <a href="research/tapir/">TAPIR</a>, where we are grappling
with how to explain providing consistency with inconsistency (with any
consistency). Of course, this also serves as dinner conversation for
me and <a href="http://drkp.net">Dan</a>, so it is good that we have the right
words to use, at least until we have a few glasses of wine.</p>

<h3 id="consistency-vs-isolation">Consistency vs. Isolation</h3>

<p>Before we dive into the different levels of isolation and consistency
provided by distributed systems and databases, I will try to define
the guarantees themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency</strong>, as in the CAP theorem, defines how <em>copies of the set
of data items</em> in a system relate to each other. Does the system
ensure that they appear as if they are a single copy (to an
application or an external observer)? Or do they appear to have some
other apparent behavior (i.e., after some period of time they converge
to a single copy)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Coherence</strong> Someone pointed out to me that I should also
define coherence, as how <em>copies of a single item</em> relate to each
other (assuming that the system holds more than one data item).
Architects tend to define this differently from consistency due to
reasoning about a single cache line vs. multiple cache lines. As a
result, it is possible to have consistency bugs that are not coherence
bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Isolation</strong>, in ACID, defines the how <em>sets of multiple operations
on the set of data items</em> in a system relate to each other. Does the
system ensure that a set of operations (grouped together in a
<em>transaction</em>) appear as if they ran at a single point in time? Do
transactions then appear as if they each ran sequentially on a single
copy of the database?  Or some other behavior (i.e., each transaction
ran on its own snapshot of the database)?</p>

<p>In summary, (1) coherence dictates how a system orders operations for
a single data item in the system, (2) consistency dictates how a
system orders operations for the entire set of data items in the
system, and (3) isolation dictates how a system orders sets of
operations grouped in transactions over the entire set of items in the
system. As a side effect, consistency is a total ordering guarantee
for a set of replicas, while isolation is a partial ordering guarantee
(because not every transaction touches every data item).</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-c-in-acid">What about the C in ACID?</h3>

<p>Unlike isolation and CAP consistency, the ACID type of consistency is
not a system guarantee, but an application-specific invariant (e.g.,
bank account balance must be greater than 0). Enforcing this type of
consistency depends on the application as well as the system. For
example, the A, I &amp; D system guarantees ensure that application
doesn’t see uncommitted or other intermediate state, but the
application needs to ensure that it does not violate its own
invariants (e.g., the application needs to check the bank account
balance before withdrawing).</p>

<p>I’ve been reading some great old database papers recommended by Phil
Bernstein, and Thomas [1] defines, <em>internal consistency</em> as the C in
ACID and <em>mutual consistency</em> as the C in CAP (both of which should
not be confused with external consistency!), which I think is a great
way to differentiate the two.</p>

<p>As Thomas says,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The notion of internal consistency is somewhat more difficult to
define precisely. It concerns the preservation of invariant relations
that exist among items within a database. As such, internal
consistency is related to the interpretation or semantics of items in
the database. Therefore, most of the responsibility for the internal
consistency of a database must rest with the application processes
which update it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Support for this kind of consistency is available in modern database
systems, but rarely discussed.  When people are talking about the
consistency of transactional storage systems like Spanner, <strong>they are
almost always talking about isolation.</strong></p>

<h3 id="linearizability-serializability-and-others">Linearizability, Serializability and Others</h3>

<p>OK, now back to how we order operations and transactions in a storage
system.  There are so many different types of ordering guarantees that
this is a huge topic. I will primarily talk about the strongest
variants because these are the best defined.</p>

<p><strong>Sequential (or serializable) consistency</strong> ensures that the same
operations are applied in the same order to every copy of a set of
data items.</p>

<p><strong>Serializable isolation</strong> ensures that transactions execute as if
they were executing one at a time on a single copy of the database.</p>

<p><strong>Linearizable consistency</strong> ensures that the same operations are
applied in the same order to every copy of the data item and that the
order reflects the order in which the operations <em>appear</em> to execute
to an external observer (like the application).</p>

<p><strong>Strict serializable isolation</strong> ensures that transactions execute as
if they were executing one at a time on a single copy of the database
and that the order matches the order in which the transactions
<em>appear</em> to execute to an external observer (like the application).</p>

<p>There has been much discussion of externally consistent (or
linearizable) transactions since the publication of Google’s Spanner
system [2]. Traditionally, the guarantees provided by Spanner and
applied to transactions would be called strict serializability.
Practically, it doesn’t matter: <em>linearizability is just strict
serializability for single operations.</em></p>

<p>As many people have observed, we just ended up with different words
for the same thing because two research communities separately
developed the terminology. Now the two communities have collided (not
literally but that would be fun!), as distributed transactional
storage systems require both consistency and isolation guarantees, and
everyone is thoroughly confused.</p>

<h3 id="strong-isolation-without-strong-consistency">Strong isolation without strong consistency</h3>

<p>It might seem that, despite the database and systems communities
inability to coordinate, consistency and isolation are tied
together. If a storage system has one level of isolation (e.g., strict
serializability) for transactions, then it typically replicates single
data items with a matching level of consistency (e.g.,
linearizability).  Or put another way, if you want a strict serial
ordering of transactions, you need to start with a strict serial
ordering of operations, right? (See why this is confusing?)</p>

<p>Interestingly (to me anyway), this is not necessary. In the <a href="/research/tapir/">TAPIR
project</a>, we are designing a new
protocol to provide strong isolation guarantees without any
consistency guarantees. Our observation is that there is no need to
enforce both isolation <em>and</em> consistency in a transactional storage
system that uses replication. This has all kinds of benefits, like
letting us get away without using an expensive replication protocol
like Paxos.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Explaining consistency is hard and it doesn’t help that we don’t have
consistent terminology! Trying to convince people that they might want
strong isolation but not need consistency (in CAP) and probably don’t
care about that other kind of consistency (in ACID) is really hard.</p>
