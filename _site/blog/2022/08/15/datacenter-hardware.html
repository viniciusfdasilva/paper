            <h2>The Fall of Datacenter Software</h2>
	    
            <p>The research community has long predicted the death of Moore’s law and
attendant growth in datacenter hardware speeds.  In a few years,
datacenter networks will grow an order of magnitude from 40Gb to
400Gb.  Systems researchers, including myself, have been preparing for
this new world for almost a decade [1, 2].  Demikernel is the first
fully-featured nanosecond-scale OS: 100ns to get a packet from the NIC
to the app in Demikernel’s DPDK TCP stack, processing 1 million
packets per second per core, etc [3].  We achieve this scale only by
rebuilding everything in the OS from scratch and carefully engineering
for cycle counts at every step.</p>

<p>While we can engineer systems to use the least number of cycles, there
will be some lower bound to how far we can take this extreme. Thus,
systems builders and datacenter developers must start thinking of the
world beyond software and start looking to hardware for solutions.
They cannot continue focusing on software running on general-purpose
CPUs but must re-orient themselves towards specialized hardware.  Due
to its scale, any datacenter workload can be considered
general-purpose and deserving of its own hardware. We already have
hardware for our most compute-intensive tasks (e.g., ML) but
hardware offload for all is the only way forward.</p>

<h3 id="demikernel-and-kernel-bypass-for-all">Demikernel and Kernel-bypass For All</h3>
<p>Kernel-bypass is the classic example of offloading a common workload
to hardware.  Every I/O operation goes through the OS kernel,
therefore kernel-bypass I/O hardware reduces CPU usage by offloading the OS features needed
to safely let applications perform I/O from user-space.  While
kernel-bypass has been around for a long time, it has never been as
urgently needed as now.  Unfortunately, as a research community, we’ve
put very little thought into how to make kernel-bypass actually usable
for most applications.  RDMA, DPDK and previous hardware were all
largely designed for specialized, high-performance applications,
making them difficult to use and deploy.  With Demikernel, our aim was
to bring the principles of the OS kernel to kernel-bypass – including
high-level APIs and portability – thus making kernel-bypass
accessible to all datacenter applications and developers.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next-hardware-offload-for-datacenter-oses">What’s next? Hardware Offload for Datacenter OSes</h3>
<p>Demikernel is a software solution to a hardware problem: kernel-bypass
hardware is difficult to use, so we use software to raise the level of
abstraction to where applications can leverage the hardware – all
while minimizing CPU cycles.  While this solution works, it does not
address the more general problem which is: what should a hardware OS
kernel look like?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the path of software design to hardware support is a
well-trodden one: we had software MMUs before hardware ones and
software virtualization before hardware virtualization.  Software
gives systems designers the ability to flexibly design abstractions
and architectures until they are satisfied enough to bake it into
hardware.  Here are some open research questions that need to be
explored before we get to a hardware Demikernel OS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Networking: What protocol should we support in the datacenter? RDMA
and TCP are not the answers but there has been research on better
alternatives, like Homa. We likely need different protocols for
datacenter internal and external workloads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storage: Will local disks still be relevant and useful? Will all
storage be network-connected, if so, how will it be managed? Will we
care about persistence?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scheduling: How do we mediate between application demands on the
CPU, memory and I/O bandwidth in hardware? Existing hardware
resource isolation is primitive and there are no hardware mechanisms
for scheduling CPU cycles (interrupts are too clunky) or memory
(likewise for page faults).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security and isolation: Existing hardware isolation mechanisms –
page tables, processes – are far too coarse-grained to be useful.
Demikernel uses fine-grained co-routines for context switches but
it’s not clear that is the right hardware solution (and we might
have to go back to segments for memory isolation).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hardware-offload-for-all">Hardware Offload for All</h3>
<p>The datacenter operating system is simply a starting point for
hardware offload of common workloads.  For example, we’ve written
recently about how to achieve zero-copy serialization using existing
hardware features [4], but the hardware could be much better designed
for serialization and deserialization. From there, it is simply a
matter of going up the stack to JSON parsing, the REST API and other
common frameworks for datacenter workloads.  Eventually, the CPU may
only serve to direct and schedule offload devices or become an
unnecessary vestige of an earlier time in datacenter history.  For
resource management and scheduling, datacenters will still need to
dynamically shift hardware to serving workloads but that could be done
with programmable hardware and/or minimal CPU usage.  When every
datacenter workload runs on thousands of machines, using a
general-purpose processing unit to run the workload in software just
no longer makes sense.  Obviously, we are far away from such a
hardware-oriented world, but it certainly poses many interesting new
research problems.</p>
